# The Lift Programming Language
Lift is a general-purpose functional programming language with a strong focus on safety and performance. Lift's main design goal to make it easy to write programs that the compiler can reason deeply about. This allows for many benefits:

* Large classes of programmer errors are made impossible by the language or are caught by the compiler at compile-time, before even the first unit test is run.
* Lift code can be optimised heavily so that they rival the performance of code written in C or assembly, without ever compromising on safety.
* Tools like IDEs and debuggers can produce advanced diagnostics or enable a large class of code transformations (including refactoring).

Lift's syntax is inspired by Swift and falls under the C programming language family of syntaces. The name *Lift* refers both to its main influencer and to the process of *lifting* functions in functional programming.

Lift is a language that is in full development. The Lift compiler is a work in progress; there's no working prototype yet.
