		Setting a mutable property is purely syntactical sugar; Lift doesn't support functions with side effects. The form `subject.property = newValue` is rewritten as `subject = type(of: subject).property.mutator(subject, newValue: newValue)` (which is again rewritten if `subject` is a property).
		
		The Lift compiler automatically derives concrete types that conform to this protocol for each mutable property definition. Other types can also add conformance to `MutableProperty` so that they behave like mutable properties.
